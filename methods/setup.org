** Environments
We used two primary conda environments for running the required scripts. The first is ~py37~, which contains basic Python3 packages, ~matplotlib~, and other utilities. The second is ~tf_gpu~, which is configured to run TensorFlow 1.14 using GPU acceleration. This package will take longer to install so is provided separately. See the conda YAML files. Also provided are environments for Python 2 and PyTorch.
