These concentrate entropy so efficiently that the halo contribution can be bigger than the core supermassive black hole. Formation of IMBHs is briefly discussed. |http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/|

A notable example is phenotype prediction from gene expression data, for instance, detecting human cancers, differentiating subtypes and predicting clinical outcomes. Still, clinical applications remain scarce. One reason is that the complexity of the decision rules that emerge from standard statistical learning impedes biological understanding, in particular, any mechanistic interpretation. Here we explore decision rules for binary classification utilizing only the ordering of expression among several genes; the basic building blocks are then two-gene expression comparisons. The simplest example, just one comparison, is the TSP classifier, which has appeared in a variety of cancer-related discovery studies. Decision rules based on multiple comparisons can better accommodate class heterogeneity, and thereby increase accuracy, and might provide a link with biological mechanism. We consider a general framework ("rank-in-context") for designing discriminant functions, including a data-driven selection of the number and identity of the genes in the support ("context"). We then specialize to two examples: voting among several pairs and comparing the median expression in two groups of genes. Comprehensive experiments assess accuracy relative to other, more complex, methods, and reinforce earlier observations that simple classifiers are competitive. |http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/|

First I describe how the causality requirements limit possible multi-partite measurements. Then the Lorentz transformations of quantum states are introduced, and their implications on physical qubits are described. This is used to describe relativistic effects in communication and entanglement. ||
