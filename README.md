# Re-imaging the empirical: statistical visualisation in art and science
## Project Description
_Re-imaging the empirical_ is a research project investigating the visual cultures of machine learning (ML). It is interested in the dominant role that images play in many contemporary ML projects and endeavours from AlphaGo through to style transfer. It also asks how images are used by ML models and techniques as part of a broader re-contouring of what it is to both see and know the empirical world. We use ML methods in this project to look at big datasets drawn from ML scientific scholarship to detect vectors and differences in images and their interrelations; images that have themselves been generated by ML research in statistics, physics, mathematics, computer vision and more.

The project has three threads:
- Tracing the genealogies and interrelations of images generated as a result of ML research
- Developing a new theoretical framework for thinking changes in seeing, images, and perception in a culture(s) of ML
- Investigating the role of artistic visual experimentation with ML as a space that reflexively foregrounds new ways of seeing and perceiving shaped by ML computation.

## Project Outline
#### Some of the steps in this process to date: 
- Downloading and extracting the arXiv source dataset - see [arxiv_extract.sh](https://github.com/re-imaging/re-imaging/blob/master/arxiv-src-scripts/arxiv_extract.sh)
- Creating an SQLite database to index each image and link to metadata - [sqlite-scripts](https://github.com/re-imaging/re-imaging/blob/master/sqlite-scripts)
- Querying dataset for various statistics regarding image formats, dimensions, category distributions etc. - see [statistics](https://github.com/re-imaging/re-imaging/blob/master/statistics), e.g. [general data statistics](https://github.com/re-imaging/re-imaging/blob/master/statistics/data-statistics.org)
- Running machine learning techniques such as image classification and dimensionality reduction across data
- Producing t-SNE maps of the distribution of different image features within subsets of the data
- Generating images using the image dataset using generative adversarial networks

## Image Samples

have been resized to fit within a 240x240 pixel square. Here we see a diverse collection of images.](https://github.com/re-imaging/re-imaging/blob/master/figures/montage/random_montage_144.jpg)

## Code
Work in progress.

This repository contains code, statistics, and images produced throughout the project. These materials are mostly concerned with looking at the dataset of all the images, text, and metadata contained within the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org) source files.

For detailed instructions on running the code, please look in the [methods folder](https://github.com/re-imaging/re-imaging/blob/master/methods/).

Code is written using bash, python, SQLite, jupyter, and anaconda. Tested on Ubuntu 18.04 with an NVidia graphics card.
