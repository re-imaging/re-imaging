## Project Description
_Re-imaging the empirical_ is a research project investigating the visual cultures of machine learning (ML). We are interested in the dominant role that images play in many contemporary ML projects and endeavours from AlphaGo through to style transfer. We have been inquiring into how images are used by ML models and techniques as part of a broader re-contouring of what it is to both see and know the empirical world. We use ML and dataset methods in this project drawn from scientific scholarship – specifically the pre-print repository [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) – to detect vectors and differences across scientific images; images that have themselves been generated by ML research in statistics, physics, mathematics, computer vision and more.

## Research Outputs

The project has three threads:
- Tracing the genealogies and interrelations of images generated as a result of ML research - see [_Images of the arXiv: reconfiguring large scientific datasets_](https://culturalanalytics.org/article/21374-images-of-the-arxiv-reconfiguring-large-scientific-image-datasets) published in the Journal of Cultural Analytics.
- Developing a new theoretical framework for thinking changes in seeing, images, and perception in a culture(s) of ML - see [_Platform Seeing: Images and their Invisualities_](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0263276419847508) published in Theory, Culture & Society
- Building a visual explorer web application that foregrounds new ways of seeing and perceiving shaped by ML computation - see [ImageMesh](https://imagemesh.ai/), a practical outcome of this project and an ongoing research tool for exploring a large sample of images published in arXiv articles. We encourage you to follow the errant paths these images generate as they compose and are plied by new modes and practices of machinic observation.

## Project Outline
### This repository

This GitHub repository contains the code used for the various parts of this project. This includes downloading and extracting the bulk source data from arXiv, cleaning and organising metadata, converting images, visualising slices of the dataset, running classification algorithms, encoding nearest neighbours maps, and generating images using GANs. As such, it is quite a varied and large repository, but it is hoped that some of the scripts and notebooks will be useful for projects accessing arXiv or using ML techniques on large image datasets.

## Code and documentation structure
This repository contains code, statistics, and images produced throughout the project. These materials are mostly concerned with looking at the dataset of all the images, text, and metadata contained within the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org) source files.

For detailed instructions on running the code, please look in the [methods folder](https://github.com/re-imaging/re-imaging/blob/master/methods/):
- detailed instructions on downloading and extracting the arXiv bulk data and OAI metadata in [dataset-methods](https://github.com/re-imaging/re-imaging/blob/master/methods/dataset-method.org)
- step-by-step methods for organising metadata into an SQLite database in [sqlite-method](https://github.com/re-imaging/re-imaging/blob/master/methods/sqlite-method.org)
- process of converting varied image formats to consistent size jpg images in [image-conversion](https://github.com/re-imaging/re-imaging/blob/master/methods/image-conversion.org) (additional examples in the [image-conversion](https://github.com/re-imaging/re-imaging/tree/master/image-conversion) folder)
- basic information about our [computer setup](https://github.com/re-imaging/re-imaging/blob/master/methods/setup.org)
- examples and explanation of project [documentation](https://github.com/re-imaging/re-imaging/blob/master/methods/documentation.org)
- tool for quick human [labelling of images](https://github.com/re-imaging/re-imaging/blob/master/labelling)

Code is written using bash, Python, SQLite, jupyter notebooks, and anaconda. Tested on Ubuntu 18.04 with an Intel CPU and NVidia graphics card.

### Steps for downloading, extracting, and converting arXiv images dataset: 
- Downloading and extracting the arXiv source dataset - see [arxiv_extract.sh](https://github.com/re-imaging/re-imaging/blob/master/arxiv-src-scripts/arxiv_extract.sh)
- Creating an SQLite database to index each image and link to metadata - [sqlite-scripts](https://github.com/re-imaging/re-imaging/blob/master/sqlite-scripts)
- Querying dataset for various statistics regarding image formats, dimensions, category distributions etc. - see [statistics](https://github.com/re-imaging/re-imaging/blob/master/statistics), e.g. [general data statistics](https://github.com/re-imaging/re-imaging/blob/master/statistics/data-statistics.org)
- Preparing data by converting all images to uniform sizes using ImageMagick `convert` - see the [image-conversion](https://github.com/re-imaging/re-imaging/tree/master/image-conversion) folder and in particular [convert_images_from_textfile_threaded.py](https://github.com/re-imaging/re-imaging/blob/master/image-conversion/convert_images_from_textfile_threaded.py)

### Additional processes:
- Running machine learning techniques such as image classification and dimensionality reduction across data
- Producing t-SNE maps of the distribution of different image features within subsets of the data
- Generating images using the image dataset using generative adversarial networks
